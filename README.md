# IoT_Firefighting_Robot

Abstract:
According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), it is estimated that more than 1.2 lakh deaths have been caused in India from 2010 to 2014 due to fire accidents. Although there are a lot of precautions taken against fire accidents, such natural/man-made disasters do occur now and then. Also, in this age of technology, the world is slowly turning towards automated systems. 
Combining the two, we have come up with an idea to safeguard the lives of our firefighters:
This project is about a ‘Firefighting Robot’, which will automatically sense a fire, move towards it and douse it by pumping out water on it. 
The main brain of this project is an Arduino UNO. In order to sense fire, we are using a fire sensor module (flame/fire sensor). We move the robot near the fire using DC motors, driven through a L298 motor driver module. Once it is near the fire, we put it out using water, which is carried in a container on top of the robot. The container also contains a pump to push out the water on the fire, through a tube.

We used the Arduino IDE and the code can be found in this repository.
